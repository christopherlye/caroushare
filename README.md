## Inspiration

> Save money, share textbook la! A platform for you to trade, share, give your textbooks away.

<p align="justify">Together with my two other friends, Zachary and Shah, we brainstormed ideas for our project built on ReactJS. We wanted to work on a project with a social objective as we felt that it would be more meaningful than just creating something for ourselves.</p>

<p align="justify">Working together on this project gave us a new dimension to coding as we had to distribute the work among each other, practice creating branches and merging our commits eventually to the master branch.</p>

<p align="justify">Even though the project is still a far cry from what we had intended it to be, it was a working prototype of what the actual project could look like eventually with more features added later on. Kudos to the team! ✌️</p>
