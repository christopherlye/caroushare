## Inspiration

> Save money, share textbook la! A platform for you to trade, share, give your textbooks away.

<p align="justify">I wanted to work on a project with two like-minded friends, Zachary and Shah, to create something that has a social purpose. We felt it would be more meaningful than creating something for ourselves.</p>

<p align="justify">We built our project on ReactJS after settling on this idea. We focused on building a working prototype of what we wanted the basic version to look like, priming it for more features to be added in the near future.</p>

<p align="justify">Working together on this project gave us a new dimension to coding as we had to distribute the work among ourselves, practice creating branches and eventually merging our commits to the master branch. Kudos to the team! :v:</p>
