                Every year, about 40,000 students progress to the level of
                education. This means that the amount of new textbooks being
                printed each year is at least 400,000, counting both primary and
                secondary levels. We believe that going green starts from the
                textbooks. Our dream is to create a more cohesive and generous
                society beginning with the little that we have.
